    <h2>You've Never Had This Kind of Pizza In Your Mouth</h2>
    <p>Making homemade pizza dough can sound like a lot of work, but it’s 
        so worth the bragging rights. The dough itself requires few ingredients 
        and just a little bit of rising and rest time. While you wait for the dough 
        to be ready, you can get to work prepping your tomato sauce, chopping fresh 
        vegetables, or grating the cheese you’ll put on top. Bake for 15 minutes, 
        garnish with basil (or, let’s be real, more cheese), and enjoy showing off 
        your way-better-than-takeout creation.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ½ cups warm water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>

    </ul>
